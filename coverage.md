title: Manuscripts we are currently cataloging
---

The first manuscripts we are cataloging have material directly relevant for the Homer Multitext project:

1. urn:cite:bnf:mss.gr2705
2. urn:cite:bnf:mss.coislin345
3. urn:cite:bnf:mss.gr2556
4. urn:cite:bnf:mss.gr2700
5. urn:cite:bnf:mss.grsupp652
6. urn:cite:bnf:mss.grsupp663
7. urn:cite:bsb:mss.cg88
8. urn:cite:libpal:mss.graec45


Brief identifying information about each of these manuscripts is available from the `.csv` files in this github repository:
<https://github.com/openmss/mss/tree/master/collections/mss>.  The files are organized with a single CITE namespace in each file, and are named by the CITE namespace identifier.  Manuscript identifiers beginning with the string `urn:cite:hmt`, for example, are in the `hmt` namespace, and are documented in <https://github.com/openmss/mss/tree/master/collections/mss/hmt.csv> (manuscripts from the Homer Multitext project).
